- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KristinaWhites Im learning, learning to think about what Im doing, as I made a big mess in the beginning;) and have I learned (update)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... building my website from scratch and I'm learning from scratch as well! I have lots of advil I figured out on my first attempt it is a must have.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...Everything, I get distracted easly and get in over my head....oh shiney and new, wait hold on ..see what I mean
- I guess I'm special cause I thought it told me to put this here. Special its good to me special I'm on the spectruim forgoodness sakes ;) But I still dont 100% get Github Im literially building my www while its live on a hosting site under the protection 0f coming soon
- REad me okay IcarusGamingXL.com is a gaming industry wide ecosystem that has a pholosophy of Gamer helping Gamer thru formiums and a review center/ a photobooth.
- There is nothing new about reviews influancers do them all the time. Whatws different is this will be a high concentration of reviews directly from people who purchase anything with in
- the gaming industry as whole. This includes softe for a influncer to edit his or hers gaming niche videos to mothboads, computer cases prebuilds to people like me who use hosting sites to facilitate my gaming page
- I also use get hub nothing is hands off. Github and its Claude Sonnet 4.1 will have a how to page I would have done nothing with out these to services and I want others to
- to know they can to and no nothing to start with. ASpirn and advil for the hopelessness thats gonna give you a whopping headache is neccissary but you can do it thanks to GIthub.
- Im for enough along to know this is fact. I got a bug connecting front to back to go live with the forum and review center and if I can get that fixed and working I have 7 more ideas i cant speack of yet.
- If I should be succesful IcarusGamingXL.com will have a culter of giving back. fist Idea is to find a needy kid that can affoard a PC much less a Icarus Open Air Gaming PC model number Darma-Engine-01 allwhit
- i7 Unltra 20 cores 20 threads graphics support unlocked z890 chipset on a gigabyte motherboard with 64gig DDR5 KLEVV ram, RTX3060 w/12 GIGS Vram, Artic Freeze cpu cooler 3 fans argb, PSU 850W. and give it to the kid
- success might mean we get to do that once a month I hope. More success means we do other things to I just dont know what yet. thats my read me I'm KristingWhites and Im special and so are you. I have never met a person in my life I couldnt find something about them that I didnt like.
- everyone has something you can like. people I lovbes me some people right cause thats all we we really havew that means anything relationships all kinds of them. Sorry I know this is a rant but I mean every word.
